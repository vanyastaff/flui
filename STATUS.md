## 📈 Metrics Tracking

### Performance (Target vs Current)

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Layout (1000 widgets) | <5ms | TBD | ⏳ Pending |
| Memory (medium app) | <50MB | TBD | ⏳ Pending |
| Incremental build | <5s | ~3s | ✅ Good |
| Allocations (after fix) | 10-50x fewer | TBD | ⏳ Pending |

### Quality

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Test coverage | >80% | ~40% | ⚠️ Needs work |
| Documentation | Complete | 70% | 🟡 In progress |
| Examples | All widgets | Basic | 🟡 In progress |

### Community

| Metric | Target (Year 1) | Current | Status |
|--------|-----------------|---------|--------|
| GitHub stars | 1000+ | TBD | ⏳ Pre-release |
| Contributors | 50+ | 1 | ⏳ Pre-release |
| Production apps | 10+ | 0 | ⏳ Pre-release |

## 🚨 Risks & Blockers

### Active Risks

**1. Scope Creep**
- **Risk:** Adding features delays 1.0
- **Mitigation:** Strict roadmap, defer non-critical features to 1.1
- **Status:** 🟢 Managed

**2. API Stability**
- **Risk:** Breaking changes after 1.0 hurt users
- **Mitigation:** Careful design review, 0.9 beta period
- **Status:** 🟢 Planned

**3. Performance Regression**
- **Risk:** New abstractions could be slower
- **Mitigation:** Continuous benchmarking
- **Status:** 🟡 Monitor

### Current Blockers

**None** - Ready to start Week 1-2 tasks

## 📅 Key Dates

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Week 2 | BoxedWidget elimination complete |
| Week 4 | Foundation fixes complete |
| Week 8 | Core features complete |
| Week 10 | Documentation complete |
| Week 12 | **1.0 RELEASE** 🎉 |

---

## 🎯 This Week's Goals

### Week 1-2 Focus
1. Design AnyWidget enum
2. Implement StatelessWidget changes
3. Update core widgets
4. Benchmark allocation improvements

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Zero `BoxedWidget` in hot paths
- [ ] 10-50x fewer allocations (measured)
- [ ] All examples work
- [ ] No performance regressions

## 🎉 Motivation

**Why are we doing this?**

Because Rust deserves a world-class UI framework that:
- Leverages Rust's strengths (safety, performance, zero-cost)
- Learns from 10+ years of UI framework evolution
- Provides 10x better developer experience than alternatives
- Enables production-ready applications from day one

**We're not just building another UI framework - we're building THE Rust UI framework.** 🚀
