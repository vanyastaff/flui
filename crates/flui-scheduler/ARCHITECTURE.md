# flui-scheduler Architecture

Per-crate ledger for architecture decisions that span more than one module in
this crate, as required by [`docs/PORT.md`](../../docs/PORT.md) §Per-crate
`ARCHITECTURE.md` template. Partial: this file exists for the `## Mapping
decisions` entries below; a full crate architecture writeup is deferred.

## Mapping decisions

### No legacy, lock-tied frame-callback registration API

**Rule:** every callback family this scheduler owns must invoke user code
with **no scheduler-owned storage lock held**. A callback must be free to
call back into the scheduler, including a read-only accessor such as
`current_frame()`.

**Conflict:** issue #1058 found one family that violated this: the retired
`schedule_frame`/`FrameCallback` registration, paired with
`handle_begin_frame`'s dispatch loop
(`if let Some(timing) = self.inner.frame.current_frame.lock().as_ref() {
callback(timing); }`), kept the `current_frame` guard alive for the whole
call — the `if let` scrutinee's temporary lives through the block even
under edition 2024's if-let rescoping. A registered callback that called
`current_frame()` deadlocked on itself; a bounded reproduction timed out at
5 seconds.

**Choice:** delete the API outright rather than fix the lock scope in
place. Flutter's `SchedulerBinding` has no second, "legacy" transient
registration path carrying different timing-argument semantics next to
`scheduleFrameCallback` (`scheduler/binding.dart` @ 3.44.0): its transient
callbacks receive the vsync `Instant`, and there is no `&FrameTiming`-argument
sibling of that same family. The retired API had no distinct
semantics to preserve: its only production caller
(`RenderingFlutterBinding::request_visual_update`) passed an empty
closure, and every other caller in the crate's own doctest/examples used it
identically to `schedule_frame_callback`. Per this crate's
active-development posture (no shims, no deprecated aliases), the fix is
the deletion, not a lock-scope patch that leaves a second,
narrower-purpose registration API standing.

**Every remaining callback family already followed, and continues to
follow, the no-lock-held rule.** This is proven by a shared test oracle
(`scheduler/lock_discipline_tests.rs`'s `assert_no_scheduler_lock_held`,
`#[cfg(test)]`, exhaustively destructuring `FrameState`/`CallbackState`/
`BindingState` plus a `TaskQueue`/`AsyncDriver` probe so a new lock cannot
be added to any of them without this oracle noticing) that `try_lock()`s
every mutex a callback could legally observe and asserts each is free,
invoked from inside a callback registered in every family: transient,
persistent, shared post-frame, owner-local post-frame, idle, microtask,
lifecycle listener, timings callback, and the `on_frame_scheduled`
platform-wake hook. Three sibling sites shared a
related but distinct hazard: `Vec::retain` drops the *removed* element
while the collection's lock is still held, so a cancelled/removed
callback's `Drop` could deadlock the same way if it re-entered the
scheduler. All three were fixed the same release
(`cancel_frame_callback`, `remove_lifecycle_state_listener`, and, for
consistency, `remove_timings_callback`) by locating the match under the
lock without a full-`Vec` copy (`position`+`remove` for the two
`CallbackId`-addressed sites, `extract_if` for the `Arc::ptr_eq`-addressed
one) and dropping it only after the guard falls. Two of the three carry a
bounded reproduction
(`cancel_frame_callback_drops_the_cancelled_callback_outside_the_lock`,
`remove_lifecycle_state_listener_drops_the_removed_listener_outside_the_lock`);
`remove_timings_callback`'s hazard is not reachable through its own public
signature (see that test's own doc comment for why), so its test is a
plain removal-correctness regression instead of a deadlock reproduction.

**Alternatives considered:**

- Snapshot `FrameTiming` under the lock and release it before invoking the
  legacy callback, keeping the API. Rejected: it does not remove the
  question of why two registration paths exist with overlapping purpose,
  and the active-dev policy in `docs/PORT.md`/`AGENTS.md` prefers reshaping
  a wrong-shaped API over patching around it when nothing depends on its
  distinct behavior.
- Make `current_frame`'s mutex reentrant (e.g. `parking_lot::ReentrantMutex`).
  Rejected per the issue's own "possible direction" note: it would mask the
  same class of bug at every other call site instead of enforcing the
  no-lock-held discipline structurally.

**Trade-off accepted:** none observed. The deleted API had exactly one
production call site, itself replaced by the gated `ensure_visual_update`
call described below, and no external consumer of this crate (pre-1.0,
unpublished) depends on it.

### `request_visual_update` routes through the `frames_enabled` gate, not the raw one

**Rule:** requesting a frame in response to pipeline work must honor
`frames_enabled`. This adopts *part* of Flutter's `ensureVisualUpdate`
(`scheduler/binding.dart` @ 3.44.0): it calls the equally
`framesEnabled`-gated `scheduleFrame()`. It does **not** adopt
`ensureVisualUpdate`'s other early-return: Flutter also no-ops while the
scheduler is already mid-frame, inside `SchedulerPhase.transientCallbacks`,
`.midFrameMicrotasks`, or `.persistentCallbacks`. `UpdateScheduler::ensure_visual_update`
checks `frames_enabled` only, with no phase check at all — this is a named
gap, not a hidden one (see **Recorded gap** below), and this crate's own
`.flutter/` reference clone was unavailable while writing this entry, so
the phase list above is recorded from the reviewing pass that found the
gap, not independently re-verified against Flutter source here.

**Conflict:** `RenderingFlutterBinding::request_visual_update`
(`flui-app`'s `bindings/renderer_binding.rs`) called the retired
`schedule_frame`, which pushed onto the (now-deleted) legacy queue and then
called the **ungated** `request_frame()` directly. A binding whose
scheduler had frames disabled (backgrounded app, `Hidden`/`Paused`/
`Detached` lifecycle state) would still schedule a frame on every pipeline
request.

**Choice:** `request_visual_update` now calls
`UpdateScheduler::ensure_visual_update()`, which already existed as the
`frames_enabled` gate (`ensure_visual_update` calls
`schedule_frame_if_enabled`, which calls `request_frame` only when
`frames_enabled` is true) and needed no new code, only a caller.
`crates/flui-app/src/bindings/renderer_binding.rs`'s test module pins both
edges:
`request_visual_update_does_not_schedule_a_frame_while_frames_are_disabled`
and `request_visual_update_schedules_a_frame_while_frames_are_enabled`.

**Alternatives considered:**

- Gate inside `request_visual_update` itself (`if scheduler.frames_enabled()
  { scheduler.request_frame(); }`), duplicating `schedule_frame_if_enabled`'s
  body at the call site. Rejected: the scheduler already owns this exact
  check; a second copy in a consuming crate is the kind of drift this
  crate's own `should_schedule_frame`/`schedule_frame_if_enabled` pair
  exists to prevent.

**Recorded gap, deliberately not closed here:** Flutter's `ensureVisualUpdate`
skips scheduling a *new* frame while one is already running
(`transientCallbacks`/`midFrameMicrotasks`/`persistentCallbacks`), because a
pipeline request arriving mid-frame is already going to be served by the
frame in progress. `UpdateScheduler` has no such phase-based dedup for
`request_frame`/`ensure_visual_update` today; it only coalesces on the
`frame_scheduled` flag (see `request_frame_impl`). Implementing the phase
check is a pacing/scheduling-topology change, out of scope for this fix
(which closes the deadlock and the `frames_enabled` gap only) and is left
as a follow-up rather than silently assumed done.

**Trade-off accepted:** the `frames_enabled` fix ships now; the mid-frame
phase check above does not, and is named rather than implied.
