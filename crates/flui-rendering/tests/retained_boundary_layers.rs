//! A clean repaint boundary reuses its previous frame's layers.
//!
//! `run_paint` used to descend the whole tree every pass and rebuild every
//! layer, which `benches/paint.rs` measured: eight dirty boundaries cost the
//! same as one. Now a boundary absent from the paint queue is grafted from
//! `retained_boundaries` instead of repainted.
//!
//! That is sound only because the queue is exact — `run_layout` marks every
//! boundary layout touched and `mark_needs_paint` marks the rest — so the two
//! properties worth pinning are that reuse HAPPENS and that it produces the
//! same tree painting would have.
