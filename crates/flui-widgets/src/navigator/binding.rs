//! [`RouteBinding`] — the owned capability a route uses to drive its own
//! lifecycle: the route-animation seam.
//!
//! `RouteBinding` itself stays private — it can finalize and dispose routes — but
//! the opaque [`RouteBindingSlot`] a route hands the
//! navigator to receive one is exported. See *Correction 2* and its resolution below.
//!
//! # What Flutter does
//!
//! A Flutter `Route` holds `_navigator` and calls back into it directly:
//!
//! ```dart
//! // routes.dart:87-94 — OverlayRoute.didPop, i.e. DURING _flushHistoryUpdates
//! if (finishedWhenPopped) { navigator!.finalizeRoute(this); }
//!
//! // navigator.dart:5825-5828 — finalizeRoute
//! entry.finalize();
//! if (!_flushingHistory) { _flushHistoryUpdates(rearrangeOverlay: false); }
//! ```
//!
//! So `finalizeRoute` mutates the entry **immediately** and merely declines to
//! start a *nested* flush while one is running. `handlePush`'s
//! `whenCompleteOrCancel` (`navigator.dart:3276-3290`) is the opposite: it
//! `assert(!navigator._debugLocked)`, because a `TickerFuture` completion always
//! arrives on a later microtask, never inside a flush.
//!
//! # Correction 1 to ADR-0020: a direct callback would **deadlock**
//!
//! ADR-0020 proposed a `RouteBinding` exposing `notify_push_completed()` and
//! `finalize()` as direct navigator callbacks. That cannot work.
//! `NavigatorShared::mutate` holds `history.lock()` for the whole flush, and
//! `parking_lot::Mutex` is not reentrant — a route calling back into
//! `RouteHistory` from `did_pop` would hang, not panic.
//!
//! So a binding **enqueues a [`RouteCommand`]** onto a queue guarded by its own
//! mutex, then calls a `wake` closure. `wake` uses `try_lock` on the history: if
//! it succeeds we are outside a flush and the commands are applied and flushed
//! at once; if it fails, a flush is in progress on this thread and *that* flush
//! drains the queue before it returns. The queue is Flutter's `_flushingHistory`
//! check, expressed as ownership rather than as a flag.
//!
//! This preserves both invariants: `RouteHistory` never learns about the
//! navigator (so `route_stack_flush_is_pure_data` stays green), and the
//! `BUG: flush_history_updates re-entered` assert stays reachable for a genuinely
//! recursive `flush()` — which is what it was always guarding.
//!
//! # Correction 2 to ADR-0020: `install(&mut self, binding)` cannot be
//!
//! `Route` is public. Threading a `&RouteBinding` through
//! `Route::install` would force `RouteBinding` into the public surface, which
//! was explicitly not authorized. The binding was therefore delivered
//! through `BoundRoute`, a private trait, from a private `push_bound` — which is
//! why `RouteId` is minted up front rather than inside `RouteRecord::erase`.
//!
//! **Resolution.** `PageRoute` and `PopupRoute` are public and must be
//! pushable through the one public `NavigatorHandle::push`, so a private
//! `push_bound` no longer works. `BoundRoute` is gone. In its place
//! [`NavigatorRoute::binding_slot`] returns an optional [`RouteBindingSlot`]: a
//! public, opaque cell with no public accessor. `push` fills it before `install()`.
//! The capability stays private; only the *cell* is public, and a route that does
//! not animate returns `None` and never sees one.
//!
