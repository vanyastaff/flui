//! [`HeroController`] — the measurement half of Flutter's hero machinery.
//!
//! ADR-0021 U3 (the controller) and U3.5 (the manifests). **Private**: nothing here
//! is exported.
//!
//! This is the observer that decides *when* a flight starts, *where* its destination
//! will be, and *which heroes* fly. It records [`HeroFlightManifest`] values for
//! diagnostics/tests and hands valid ones to the private flight manager. The flight
//! itself — the overlay entry, `RectTween`, shuttle, and driving animation — lives in
//! `hero_flight.rs` (U4).
//!
//! The pieces it stands on already exist: the private [`Hero`] view, the per-route
//! [`HeroRegistry`] behind an ambient [`HeroScope`], and [`HeroHandle`] with its
//! `start_flight` / `end_flight` placeholder machinery (`hero.rs`, U3.5). The
//! controller still does not call `start_flight` directly — the private `HeroFlight`
//! does that when launched.
//!
//! [`Hero`]: super::hero::Hero
//! [`HeroRegistry`]: super::hero::HeroRegistry
//! [`HeroScope`]: super::hero::HeroScope
//! [`HeroHandle`]: super::hero::HeroHandle
//!
//! # What this is a port of
//!
//! `.flutter/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/heroes.dart`, master
//! `3.33.0-0.0.pre-6280-g88e87cd963f`:
//!
//! * `HeroController.didChangeTop` (`:853-869`) → [`HeroController::did_change_top`].
//!   Note it overrides **only** `didChangeTop` — never `didPush`/`didPop`, which a
//!   port is tempted to reach for and which fire for routes that never become the
//!   top one;
//! * `_maybeStartHeroTransition` (`:911-976`) → [`HeroController::maybe_start`];
//! * `_startHeroTransition`'s prologue and matching loop (`:979-1060`) →
//!   [`MeasurementPass`].
//!
//! The whole design rests on one comment (`:964-966`):
//!
//! > *Putting a route offstage changes its animation value to 1.0. Once this frame
//! > completes, we'll know where the heroes in the `to` route are going to end up,
//! > and the `to` route will go back onstage.*
//!
//! So the sequence is: flip the destination offstage → let the frame build, lay out
//! and commit → measure from a post-frame callback → put it back onstage. Every
//! piece of that is a seam this ADR built, and this controller is the first thing
//! that composes them:
//!
//! | Step | Seam | Landed in |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `toRoute.offstage = …` (`:967`) | [`ModalHandle::set_offstage`] via the navigator's modal registry | U3 |
//! | `didChangeTop` (`navigator.dart:4590-4596`) | `Notification::TopChanged`, delivered outside the history lock | U2 + §7f |
//! | offstage ⇒ `animation.value == 1.0` (`routes.dart:1958`) | the `ModalRoute` animation proxies | U3 |
//! | `addPostFrameCallback` (`:968`) | [`PostFrameHandle`] | U2 |
//! | the callback runs *after* layout commits | `Scheduler::drive_frame` | U1.5 |
//! | `to.subtreeContext` (`:1014`) | [`RouteSubtree`] | U2 |
//! | `subtreeContext.findRenderObject()!.size` (`:952`) | `PipelineOwner::box_size` | U1 |
//! | `getTransformTo(navigatorRenderObject)` (`:1029`) | `PipelineOwner::transform_to` | U1 |
//! | `navigator` on an observer (`navigator.dart:779`) | [`NavigatorObserver::did_attach`] | U2 |
//! | `Hero._allHeroesFor(subtreeContext)` (`:1014`) | per-route `HeroRegistry`, filled by registration rather than an element walk | U3.5 |
//! | `_boundingBoxFor(hero, route.subtreeContext)` (`:501-509`) | `HeroHandle::bounding_box_in` | U3.5 |
//!
//! # What is deliberately absent
//!
//! The customization hooks landed in §7n: `Hero::create_rect_tween`,
//! `Hero::flight_shuttle_builder` (with the no-foreign-`BuildContext` divergence),
//! FLUI's state-preserving `Hero::placeholder` (in place of Flutter's lossy
//! `placeholderBuilder`), and `Hero::curve` / `Hero::reverse_curve` with Flutter's
//! `Curves.fastOutSlowIn` default (`heroes.dart:181`). `FlightDirection` is public
//! for the shuttle builder, and `HeroMode` grounds a subtree (§7p). Still absent:
//! `transitionOnUserGestures`.
//!
//! The private surface stays private: `HeroTag`, `HeroRegistry`, `HeroScope`,
//! `HeroHandle`, `HeroFlightManifest`, and the flight machinery are `pub(crate)`, and
//! `navigator_tests::public_no_internal_route_stack_exports` fails if any is exported.
//!
//! Full nested-navigator flight parity remains deferred. `HeroControllerScope::none`
//! isolates nested navigators by default, and a nested navigator can host its own
//! controller, but cross-navigator hero matching is still out of scope.
//!
//! No `userGestureInProgress` either: FLUI has no back-swipe, so
//! `isUserGestureTransition` is always `false`. That collapses `didStartUserGesture`
//! / `didStopUserGesture` (`heroes.dart:871-889`) and the `hasValidSize` fast path
//! (`:952-960`) — which only ever runs for a gesture-driven pop — out of this port.
//! Both are recorded as absent, not as done.
//!
//! [`ModalHandle::set_offstage`]: super::modal_route::ModalHandle::set_offstage
//! [`PostFrameHandle`]: flui_scheduler::PostFrameHandle
//! [`RouteSubtree`]: super::subtree::RouteSubtree

// `HeroController` measures and launches private flights, but nothing constructs a
// controller in production yet — a `Navigator` gains one only when the public `Hero`
// API lands — so the tests are this module's only callers, and `dead_code` cascades
// from here into the `ModalHandle` / `RouteBinding` / `HeroRegistry` seams it is the
// sole production consumer of. Deleting it and re-deriving it later is how a seam
// stops matching the ADR that specified it.
