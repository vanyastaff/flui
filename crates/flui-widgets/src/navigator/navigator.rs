//! [`Navigator`], [`NavigatorState`] and [`NavigatorHandle`].
//!
//! ADR-0019 U3 introduced the private widget. ADR-0019 U4 exported the signed-off
//! `Navigator` baseline; ADR-0020 U5.4 added public page/popup routes; ADR-0021 U6
//! added the public Hero baseline that rides on this navigator.
//!
//! # Flutter parity
//!
//! `.flutter/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/navigator.dart` (master
//! `3.33.0-0.0.pre-6280-g88e87cd963f`): `NavigatorState`, `Navigator.of` /
//! `maybeOf` (`:2947-3001`), `canPop` (`:5551`), `maybePop` (`:5582`),
//! `_allRouteOverlayEntries` (`:4151`), and `build` returning an `Overlay`
//! (`:5984`).
//!
//! # How this avoids Flutter's two `GlobalKey`s, and the lock hazard behind them
//!
//! ADR-0019 §3.2. `BuildContext::find_ancestor_state` yields `&dyn Any` —
//! *immutable* — while the element tree is borrowed. So `Navigator::of` can never
//! return `&mut NavigatorState`, and it must not perform a second lookup inside
//! that callback: Flutter's `_overlayKey.currentState` would take the GlobalKey
//! registry's `WidgetsBinding::inner.read()` while the tree borrow is held, and
//! `parking_lot::RwLock` is not reentrant.
//!
//! Both problems dissolve the same way. `Navigator::of` clones an owned,
//! `'static` [`NavigatorHandle`] out of the state *inside* the callback and does
//! nothing else there; every mutation runs after the borrow is released. Navigator
//! and Overlay couple through an `Arc`, not through the tree — so
//! `GlobalKey<OverlayState>` is not ported either, and `navigator_uses_no_global_key`
//! keeps it that way.
//!
//! # Not implemented, and not claimed
//!
//! No Navigator 2.0/page-list API, restoration, named-route generation, `PopScope`,
//! `LocalHistoryRoute`, `HeroControllerScope`, `NavigationNotification`,
//! pointer-cancelling wrapper, or per-route focus scope that Flutter's `build` adds
//! (`:5946-5998`). `TransitionRoute` / `ModalRoute` stay private implementation
//! details behind public `PageRoute` / `PopupRoute`.
