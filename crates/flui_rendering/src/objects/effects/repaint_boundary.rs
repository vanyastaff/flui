/// RenderObject that creates a repaint boundary
///
/// This widget creates a separate paint layer, isolating the child's
/// repainting from its ancestors. When the child repaints, only this
/// subtree needs to be repainted, not the entire widget tree.
///
/// Useful for optimizing performance when a widget repaints frequently
/// (e.g., animations, videos, interactive elements).
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use flui_rendering::RenderRepaintBoundary;
///
/// // Create repaint boundary for animated child
/// let boundary = RenderRepaintBoundary::new();
/// ```
#[derive(Debug)]

        // - Create a cached layer if is_repaint_boundary is true
        // - Reuse the cached layer on subsequent paints if child hasn't changed
        // - Mark the layer as dirty when the child needs repainting
        //
        // This allows the framework to cache the layer and avoid
        // repainting the child if only the parent changes
        //
        // For now, we just paint the child directly
