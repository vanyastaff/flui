//! Interaction widgets - widgets that control pointer event handling
//!
//! This module provides widgets for controlling how pointer events are handled:
//!
//! - **IgnorePointer**: Makes widget transparent to pointer events (events pass through)
//! - **AbsorbPointer**: Blocks pointer events from reaching widgets behind
//! - **MouseRegion**: Tracks mouse enter/exit/hover events
