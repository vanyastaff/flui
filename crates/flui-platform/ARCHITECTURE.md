# flui-platform Architecture

Per-crate ledger for architecture decisions that span more than one module in
this crate, as required by [`docs/PORT.md`](../../docs/PORT.md) §Per-crate
`ARCHITECTURE.md` template. Partial: this file exists for the `## Mapping
decisions` entries below; a full crate architecture writeup is deferred.

## Mapping decisions

### The winit backend delegates the whole keyboard event to `ui-events-winit`; Win32/AppKit keep hand-written tables

**Rule:** every native keyboard event this crate receives must be normalized
into the canonical `ui_events`/`keyboard-types` vocabulary (`Code`, `Key`,
`Location`) at the platform boundary — see `traits/input.rs`'s module doc.
`Code::Unidentified` must mean the backend genuinely could not identify the
physical key, never that a conversion table was incomplete (issue #1092).

**Choice:** the winit backend's `platforms/winit/events.rs::keyboard_event`
converts the whole `winit::event::KeyEvent` (code, logical key, location,
down/up state, `repeat`, and modifiers) through
`ui_events_winit::keyboard::from_winit_keyboard_event` (crates.io
`ui-events-winit`, the same bridge Masonry and Xilem use) instead of
hand-assembling any `KeyboardEvent` field itself; `platform.rs`'s
`ModifiersChanged` handler stores winit's raw `ModifiersState` rather than a
pre-converted `keyboard_types::Modifiers`, and each read site (pointer paths
and the keyboard path alike) converts through the crate's
`from_winit_modifier_state` at the point of use. The Win32 (`shared/keys.rs`)
and AppKit (`shared/keys_macos.rs`) backends keep their own hand-written
`Code`/`Key` tables, because no equivalent bridge crate exists for
`WM_KEYDOWN` scancodes or `NSEvent.keyCode` — those two native id spaces are
FLUI-specific translation work with no upstream crate to delegate to.

Location is also sourced differently than before this issue: winit's own
`KeyEvent.location: KeyLocation` field feeds `from_winit_keyboard_event`
directly, rather than being re-derived from the physical `Code` (the
pre-#1092 code matched a hand-picked list of `KeyCode` variants against
`Location::Numpad`/`Left`/`Right` — exactly the incomplete-table failure
mode this issue fixed for `code` too). There is no "does `Code::X` imply
`Location::Numpad`" property left to hold; winit already computes location
per-platform and exposes it, so nothing here re-derives it.

This asymmetry between backends is deliberate, not inconsistent: the rule is
"delegate to an audited bridge when one exists for this native surface," not
"every backend must look the same." `platforms/winit/events/keyboard_tests.rs`'s
`cross_backend_physical_key_agreement` test cross-checks a curated set of
physical keys against both hand-written tables so the two authored
translations and the delegated one cannot silently drift apart.

**Alternatives considered:**

- Complete the crate's own hand-written `winit::KeyCode → Code` table (kept
  as a dev-dependency oracle test against `ui-events-winit`, never shipped).
  Rejected: it is a second, unaudited copy of exactly the table the bridge
  crate already maintains and tests upstream — an ownership cost with no
  behavioral upside, and the class of bug this issue exists to fix (a
  hand-rolled table quietly falling behind the enum it mirrors).
- Delegate only the three field-level conversions (`from_winit_code`,
  `from_winit_key`, `from_winit_location`) and keep hand-assembling
  `KeyboardEvent`'s remaining fields (down/up state, `repeat`,
  `is_composing`, and a separately hand-written modifiers conversion) in
  `keyboard_event`. This was the first shape landed for #1092 and was
  rejected on review: `from_winit_keyboard_event` and
  `from_winit_modifier_state` already do exactly that assembly, so the
  hand-written half was byte-identical duplicate logic — the same
  re-derived-seam risk the issue exists to close, just smaller.
- Vendor `ui-events-winit`'s tables directly into this crate (a `// PORT
  NOTE`-style copy). Rejected for the same reason as the first bullet, plus
  it would need re-syncing by hand on every winit/`ui-events` bump instead
  of `cargo update` doing it.

**Trade-off:** this crate's winit backend now tracks `ui-events-winit`'s
release cadence for keyboard fidelity — a regression or gap introduced
upstream reaches FLUI without a code review here. The `.github/dependabot.yml`
`ui-events-cohort` group (with `ui-events` itself) and the
`every_winit_keycode_maps_to_a_canonical_code` regression test are the
mitigations: a bump that drops coverage for a `KeyCode` variant fails CI
immediately rather than shipping silently — though that test can only pin
the dependency's own completeness, not a regression inside `keyboard_event`
itself, since `winit::event::KeyEvent` cannot be constructed outside winit
(`platform_specific` is `pub(crate)`) and so `keyboard_event` can never be
called directly from a test; see that test's doc for the full reasoning. If
the workspace's `winit` pin ever needs to move ahead of what
`ui-events-winit` supports (it pins `winit ^0.30`), the escape hatch is a
`[patch.crates-io]` pin at the upstream `ui-events-winit` git repo (plus
adding that repo to `deny.toml`'s `sources.allow-git`), not reviving a hand
table — see the dependency comment in `Cargo.toml`.

**One observable behavior change for already-working input:** a winit
`Key::Dead(_)` (a dead-key composition in progress) now reports
`Key::Named(NamedKey::Dead)` instead of `Key::Named(NamedKey::Unidentified)`
— `from_winit_key` distinguishes the two where the deleted hand table
collapsed both to `Unidentified`. Verified inert today:
`crates/flui-widgets/src/text/editable_text.rs`'s key handler matches
specific `NamedKey` variants and falls through everything else, `Dead`
included, to `Key::Named(_) => KeyEventResult::Ignored` — no consumer in the
workspace currently branches on `NamedKey::Dead` specifically (`rg
'NamedKey::Dead'` across `crates/` has no hits outside this record). Named
here so a future consumer that starts caring about dead-key state — an IME
composition indicator, for instance — knows this signal already exists on
the winit backend and does not need a new one.

**Further reading:** [`.rust-studio/specs/1092-winit-physical-key-map/survey.md`](../../.rust-studio/specs/1092-winit-physical-key-map/survey.md)
is the market/reference survey that motivated this decision (`ui-events-winit`
coverage measurement, Flutter's generated `PhysicalKeyboardKey` catalog as
the completeness precedent, and the three options evaluated before choosing
production delegation) — read it for context, not as the source of a fact;
figures cited in this entry are measured directly against this repository
and `ui-events-winit`'s own source, not against the survey.

**Replacement coverage:** `platforms/winit/events/keyboard_tests.rs`'s
`keyboard_conversion_tests` module (`every_winit_keycode_maps_to_a_canonical_code`
over all 194 winit 0.30.13 `KeyCode` variants — length- and
duplicate-checked against the winit source — plus the issue's
acceptance-criteria spot pairs and the location/logical-key spot checks) and
`cross_backend_physical_key_agreement` (winit vs. Win32 vs. AppKit on a
shared physical-key set). Before this change, `convert_physical_key`'s hand
table mapped 71 of winit 0.30.13's 194 `KeyCode` variants to `Code`
(`git show 374cca31:crates/flui-platform/src/platforms/winit/events.rs | rg
-c "KeyCode::\w+ => Code::"`) and `convert_winit_key` mapped 37 of 306
`NamedKey` variants to `Key`, falling through to `Unidentified` for the rest
in both cases.
