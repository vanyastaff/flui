//! Both builders publish an [`AsyncSnapshot`] from a spawned task and read it
//! back during `build`. The channel is the same shape as ADR-0017's
//! `LayoutConstraintsCell`: an `Arc<Mutex<…>>` the task writes and the element
//! reads, plus the bookkeeping needed to reject a write from a subscription that
//! has since been replaced.
