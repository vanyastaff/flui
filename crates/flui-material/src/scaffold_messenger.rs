//! [`ScaffoldMessenger`] — manages [`crate::SnackBar`] queuing/display for
//! every registered [`crate::Scaffold`] descendant, plus [`SnackBarController`]
//! (returned by [`ScaffoldMessengerHandle::show_snack_bar`]) and
//! [`SnackBarClosedReason`].
//!
//! # Flutter parity
//!
//! `material/scaffold.dart`'s `ScaffoldMessenger`/`ScaffoldMessengerState`
//! (oracle tag `3.44.0`), narrowed to the snack-bar half of that type (no
//! `MaterialBanner` queue — a separate, undated feature). Every citation
//! below is `scaffold.dart` unless noted.
//!
//! ## Named divergence: `AnimationController`-as-timer
//!
//! The oracle drives the per-snackbar display duration with a real
//! `dart:async` `Timer` (`_snackBarTimer`, `:619`). FLUI has no
//! frame-independent virtual-clock timer primitive yet (`flui-scheduler`
//! only drives the frame loop) — see `docs/ROADMAP.md`. This substrate
//! substitutes a second, per-snackbar [`AnimationController`] whose
//! `duration` is the snackbar's own configured display duration
//! ([`crate::SnackBar::duration`]): it is `forward()`-ed when the entrance
//! animation completes, and its own `Completed` status stands in for the
//! oracle's `Timer` callback. **Honest cost**: unlike a real timer, this
//! keeps the frame loop scheduled for the full display duration (a `Vsync`
//! registration ticks every frame, not just once at expiry) — accepted
//! because it makes the duration trivially controllable under a virtual
//! clock in tests, the same reason `crate::drawer`'s settle animation
//! already rides this mechanism. An event-driven timer is a named follow-up
//! once `flui-scheduler` grows one. The timer restarts fresh for each
//! snackbar and is cancelled on hide/remove/clear
//! (`MessengerCore::cancel_display_timer`).
//!
//! ## The drain state machine
//!
//! There is no separate `enum` tracking Idle/Entering/Displayed/Exiting: the
//! entrance controller's own [`AnimationStatus`] already carries every bit of
//! that state (`Dismissed` = idle, `Forward` = entering, `Completed` =
//! displayed, `Reverse` = exiting) with the queue as the one piece it does
//! not — an earlier version of this module shadowed that status in a
//! `DrainState` cell, which nothing ever read except its own tests, exactly
//! the "two sources of truth, one inert" shape this module now avoids.
//! `MessengerCore::handle_entry_status` translates a *change* in that status
//! into the one queue-affecting consequence it has (`Dismissed` → pop and
//! advance to the next entry; `Completed` → start the display timer) — `pop
//! and advance` on `Dismissed`, then immediately re-entering if the queue is
//! still non-empty, IS the state machine.
//!
//! ## Why status edges are polled, not pushed, from the controller
//!
//! `AnimationController::add_status_listener` requires its callback to be
//! `Send + Sync` (`StatusCallback = Arc<dyn Fn(AnimationStatus) + Send +
//! Sync>`) because the controller itself is a general-purpose, thread-safe
//! primitive. `MessengerCore` is deliberately **not** `Send`/`Sync` — it is
//! `Rc`-based, owner-affine, the same reasoning
//! `crate::drawer::DrawerHandle`'s module doc gives (and its queue's
//! `on_closed` slots are plain `Box<dyn FnOnce(..)>`, not `+ Send`, matching
//! every other UI callback in this crate). So the controllers' own listeners
//! (installed in `ScaffoldMessengerHandle::attach`/
//! `MessengerCore::start_display_timer`) do the ONE thing a `Send + Sync`
//! closure can safely do without capturing `Rc` state: reschedule
//! [`ScaffoldMessenger`]'s own rebuild via a plain `RebuildHandle` (itself
//! `Send + Sync`).
//!
//! The actual state-machine translation — "did a controller's status change
//! since we last looked, and if so what does that mean for the queue" —
//! lives in `MessengerCore::reconcile`, called from two places: **directly,
//! synchronously**, at the end of every queue-mutating method
//! (`show_snack_bar`/`hide_current`/`remove_current`/`clear`) so an explicit
//! call observes its own effect immediately (no frame boundary needed — the
//! "remove twice rapidly" test below asserts on this), and from
//! [`ScaffoldMessengerState::build`] (scheduled by the Send-safe listeners)
//! for the natural case where a controller settles purely from ticking, with
//! no explicit API call in between. `reconcile` loops until a full pass
//! detects no further change, so it correctly drains a multi-step cascade
//! (e.g. `Dismissed` → pop → `forward()` → `Forward`) within one call.
//! `reconcile` never holds the `queue` `RefCell` borrowed across a call back
//! into the controller or into caller-supplied code
//! (`SnackBarController::on_closed`) — this crate has shipped five separate
//! `RefCell`/lock-held-over-closure incidents, and `forward()`/`reverse()`/
//! `set_value()` change status *synchronously*, so an `on_closed` callback
//! that itself calls back into `show_snack_bar`/`remove_current_snack_bar`
//! reaches this same machine again, from the same call stack.
//!
//! **Queue-wedge invariant**: *the queue is non-empty ⇒ the entrance
//! controller is not `Dismissed`, except transiently inside
//! `MessengerCore::pop_and_advance` itself.* Maintaining this is what lets
//! `MessengerCore::hide_current` simply early-return when the controller is
//! already `Dismissed` (oracle parity — nothing to hide). But
//! `MessengerCore::remove_current`/`MessengerCore::clear` have no such
//! early return in the oracle (`removeCurrentSnackBar` only checks
//! `_snackBars.isEmpty`) — calling `set_value(0.0)` on an ALREADY-`Dismissed`
//! controller is a **no-op status change**: `set_value` only fires a status
//! *transition* on an actual change, so an edge-only drain would silently
//! wedge the queue forever the moment `remove`/`clear` is called while the
//! controller is already settled at `Dismissed` (reachable via the exact
//! re-entrancy this module warns about: an `on_closed` callback that itself
//! calls `remove_current_snack_bar`). Both methods therefore check
//! `status() == Dismissed` themselves and, when true, directly call
//! `pop_and_advance` instead of routing through `set_value`.
//! `MessengerCore::advancing` guards `pop_and_advance` itself against
//! double-entry from that same re-entrant path.
//!
//! ## Deferring `on_closed` out of the build phase
//!
//! `MessengerCore::reconcile` runs from two kinds of call site with
//! different obligations, captured in `ReconcileOrigin`:
//!
//! - **`ReconcileOrigin::Direct`** — synchronously, at the end of every
//!   public [`ScaffoldMessengerHandle`] method (`show_snack_bar`/
//!   `hide_current_snack_bar`/`remove_current_snack_bar`/`clear_snack_bars`),
//!   which only ever run from event-handler call stacks. `on_closed` fires
//!   immediately here — Flutter parity: `removeCurrentSnackBar` completes its
//!   completer synchronously, in the same call.
//! - **`ReconcileOrigin::Build`** — from [`ScaffoldMessengerState::build`],
//!   reached when the Send-safe controller listeners scheduled a rebuild for
//!   a PURELY tick-driven status settle (no explicit API call in between —
//!   e.g. the entrance animation finishing, or the display timer expiring
//!   and starting the exit reverse, which later settles on its own). Firing
//!   arbitrary caller-supplied `on_closed` code inline, mid-`build`, is the
//!   same hazard trigger #22 names for `rebuild_handle`/`post_frame_handle`
//!   themselves: an `on_closed` that calls `show_snack_bar` would mutate the
//!   queue and schedule further rebuilds *after* this build's siblings have
//!   already built against the pre-mutation tree, silently.
//!   `MessengerCore::pop_and_advance` instead defers the fire through the
//!   [`flui_scheduler::PostFrameHandle`] acquired in
//!   [`ScaffoldMessengerState::init_state`] (ADR-0021) — the callback runs
//!   after this frame's build/layout/paint have committed, its own reentrant
//!   `show_snack_bar`/etc. call landing squarely in a safe, ordinary
//!   event-handler-shaped window. If no `PostFrameHandle` is available (the
//!   messenger was never `attach`ed — a bare unit test constructing
//!   [`ScaffoldMessengerHandle`] directly), the fire falls back to
//!   synchronous, the same as `Direct`, rather than silently dropping the
//!   callback.
//!
//! State BOOKKEEPING (which entry is at the front, the recorded reason,
//! whether the display timer is running) is safe to mutate from `build` —
//! only the arbitrary-code DISPATCH of `on_closed` needs to leave it.
//!
//! ## Multi-scaffold fan-out
//!
//! `show_snack_bar` shows the current entry on every registered
//! [`crate::Scaffold`] simultaneously (oracle: `_updateScaffolds` iterates
//! `_scaffolds`, `:231-238`) — [`crate::Scaffold`] itself reads
//! `ScaffoldMessengerHandle::current_entry` (private) in its own `build`. **Named
//! divergence**: the oracle additionally narrows this to the *root* scaffold
//! of a nested set (`_isRoot`, `:242-245`, comparing
//! `findAncestorStateOfType<ScaffoldState>`); this substrate has no
//! ancestor-state lookup by concrete `ViewState` type, so nested-`Scaffold`
//! double-show is not filtered — every registered scaffold shows the current
//! snack bar, nested or not. Tracked, not silently dropped.
//!
//! ## `clearSnackBars`
//!
//! Drops every queued (not-yet-shown) entry's `on_closed` **silently** — no
//! callback fires, matching the oracle dropping their `Completer`s
//! unfulfilled (`:463-472`; a never-completed `Future` observably never
//! resolves, the same as a callback that never runs). The current entry is
//! then hidden via `MessengerCore::hide_current` with
//! [`SnackBarClosedReason::Hide`] — `clearSnackBars` delegates to
//! `hideCurrentSnackBar()`, whose reason parameter defaults to
//! `SnackBarClosedReason.hide` (`:441`), *not* `.remove` as its name might
//! suggest.
//!
//! ## Completion slot
//!
//! Each queued entry carries a `reason` cell the eventual pop reads (falling
//! back to [`SnackBarClosedReason::Remove`] only in the unreachable-in-
//! practice case of a pop with no reason ever recorded). It is set two
//! different ways, matching an asymmetry in the oracle itself:
//!
//! - `QueuedEntry::set_reason_once` (hide, timeout) — **provisional**: only
//!   applies if nothing has been recorded yet. Flutter parity:
//!   `hideCurrentSnackBar`'s completion is itself deferred to
//!   `_snackBarController!.reverse().then(...)` — it does not complete
//!   anything until the reverse actually settles, so whatever reason is
//!   recorded here is only a promise about what a LATER completion will
//!   carry, not a completion itself.
//! - `QueuedEntry::set_reason` (remove) — **unconditional overwrite**.
//!   Flutter parity: `removeCurrentSnackBar` completes the still-pending
//!   completer with ITS OWN reason immediately, `if (!completer.isCompleted)`
//!   — a race it always wins against a hide/timeout that recorded a reason
//!   but has not yet actually completed (settled to `Dismissed`). So a
//!   `remove_current_snack_bar()` call arriving mid-reverse (after an
//!   earlier `hide_current_snack_bar()`) must report `Remove`, not the
//!   hide's own `Hide` — see `hide_then_remove_mid_reverse_reports_remove`.
//!
//! Both a provisional (hide/timeout) and a completed (remove/action) call
//! only ever *record* a reason on the entry — see the previous section for
//! when that recording turns into an actual `on_closed` fire.
//!
//! ## V1 scope
//!
//! Reachable in V1: [`SnackBarClosedReason::Timeout`],
//! [`SnackBarClosedReason::Hide`], [`SnackBarClosedReason::Remove`],
//! [`SnackBarClosedReason::Action`]. [`SnackBarClosedReason::Dismiss`] and
//! [`SnackBarClosedReason::Swipe`] exist for oracle parity (a future
//! close-icon / swipe-to-dismiss feature reaches them) but nothing in this
//! crate produces them yet. `SnackBar.persist`/`ModalRoute`-pausing
//! (`:614-616`) are deferred, named — the display timer always runs,
//! regardless of whether the snack bar carries an action.
