# Phase 2: State Lifecycle Enhancement

> **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
> **Date:** 2025-01-19
> **Priority:** 🟠 HIGH

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive **State Lifecycle Enhancement** as specified in ROADMAP_FLUI_CORE.md Phase 2.
This phase enhances the State lifecycle with additional callbacks, lifecycle tracking, and proper ordering.

---

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 2.1 StateLifecycle Enum

Added a comprehensive lifecycle state tracker to enforce correct ordering and prevent invalid operations.

**File:** `crates/flui_core/src/widget/mod.rs:206-240`

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
pub enum StateLifecycle {
    /// State object created but initState() not yet called
    Created,
    /// initState() called, ready to build
    Initialized,
    /// State is active and can build/rebuild
    Ready,
    /// dispose() called, state is defunct and cannot be used
    Defunct,
}

impl StateLifecycle {
    /// Check if state is mounted (can call setState)
    pub fn is_mounted(&self) -> bool {
        matches!(self, StateLifecycle::Initialized | StateLifecycle::Ready)
    }

    /// Check if state can build
    pub fn can_build(&self) -> bool {
        matches!(self, StateLifecycle::Ready)
    }
}
```

**Lifecycle Progression:**
```
Created → Initialized → Ready → Defunct
   ↓           ↓          ↓        ↓
 new()    initState()  build()  dispose()
```

---

### 2.2 Enhanced State Callbacks

#### ✅ did_change_dependencies()

Called when InheritedWidget dependencies change.

**File:** `crates/flui_core/src/widget/mod.rs:283-295`

```rust
/// Called when InheritedWidget dependencies change
///
/// This is called:
/// - Once after init_state() on first build
/// - Whenever an InheritedWidget that this state depends on changes
fn did_change_dependencies(&mut self) {}
```

**Usage:**
```rust
impl State for MyState {
    fn did_change_dependencies(&mut self) {
        // Called after initState() and when dependencies change
        let theme = self.context.depend_on_inherited_widget::<ThemeProvider>();
        self.update_theme(theme);
    }
}
```

#### ✅ reassemble()

Called during hot reload for development workflows.

**File:** `crates/flui_core/src/widget/mod.rs:314-322`

```rust
/// Called during hot reload (development only)
///
/// This gives the state a chance to reinitialize data that was prepared
/// in the constructor or init_state(), as if the object was newly created.
fn reassemble(&mut self) {}
```

**Usage:**
```rust
impl State for MyState {
    fn reassemble(&mut self) {
        // Re-initialize data during hot reload
        self.load_assets();
    }
}
```

#### ✅ deactivate() and activate()

Support for element reparenting via GlobalKeys.

**File:** `crates/flui_core/src/widget/mod.rs:324-346`

```rust
/// Called when element is removed from tree
///
/// The element may be reinserted into the tree at a different location.
/// If you need to cleanup resources, wait for dispose() instead.
fn deactivate(&mut self) {}

/// Called when element is reinserted into tree
///
/// This is called when a deactivated element is reinserted into the tree
/// at a new location (e.g., via GlobalKey reparenting).
fn activate(&mut self) {}
```

**Usage:**
```rust
impl State for MyState {
    fn deactivate(&mut self) {
        // Element removed from tree (might be reinserted)
        self.pause_animations();
    }

    fn activate(&mut self) {
        // Element reinserted at new location
        self.resume_animations();
    }
}
```

---

### 2.3 Mounted Property Tracking

#### ✅ mounted() Method

Check if state is currently mounted in the tree.

**File:** `crates/flui_core/src/widget/mod.rs:359-375`

```rust
/// Check if state is currently mounted in the tree
///
/// Returns true if the state is mounted and can safely call setState.
/// Returns false if the state has been disposed or not yet initialized.
fn mounted(&self) -> bool {
    true // Default for backward compatibility
}
```

**Usage:**
```rust
impl MyState {
    fn some_async_callback(&mut self) {
        if self.mounted() {
            // Safe to call setState
            self.update_data();
        }
    }
}
```

#### ✅ lifecycle() Method

Get the current lifecycle state.

**File:** `crates/flui_core/src/widget/mod.rs:377-387`

```rust
/// Get the current lifecycle state
///
/// This is managed internally by the framework and should not be overridden.
/// Returns the current position in the state lifecycle.
fn lifecycle(&self) -> StateLifecycle {
    StateLifecycle::Ready // Default for backward compatibility
}
```

---

### 2.4 StatefulElement Integration

Updated StatefulElement to call new lifecycle methods at appropriate times.

**File:** `crates/flui_core/src/element/mod.rs`

#### ✅ Enhanced mount()

```rust
fn mount(&mut self, parent: Option<ElementId>, _slot: usize) {
    self.parent = parent;
    self.dirty = true;

    // Call init_state() on first mount
    if let Some(state) = &mut self.state {
        state.init_state();
        // Phase 2: Call did_change_dependencies() after init_state()
        state.did_change_dependencies();
    }
}
```

#### ✅ Enhanced unmount()

```rust
fn unmount(&mut self) {
    // Phase 2: Call deactivate() before cleanup
    if let Some(state) = &mut self.state {
        state.deactivate();
    }

    // Unmount child first
    if let Some(child_id) = self.child.take() {
        if let Some(tree) = &self.tree {
            tree.write().remove(child_id);
        }
    }

    // Phase 2: Call dispose() after deactivate()
    if let Some(state) = &mut self.state {
        state.dispose();
    }
}
```

#### ✅ New Methods

**reassemble()** - Hot reload support:
```rust
pub fn reassemble(&mut self) {
    if let Some(state) = &mut self.state {
        state.reassemble();
    }
    self.dirty = true;
}
```

**activate()** - Reparenting support:
```rust
pub fn activate(&mut self) {
    if let Some(state) = &mut self.state {
        state.activate();
    }
}
```

    pub did_change_dependencies_called: bool,
    pub did_update_widget_called: bool,
    pub reassemble_called: bool,
    pub deactivate_called: bool,
    pub activate_called: bool,
    pub dispose_called: bool,
    pub build_count: usize,
}
```

---

## 🏗️ Complete Lifecycle Order

### Normal Lifecycle

```rust
1. State created via create_state()
   ↓ StateLifecycle::Created

2. init_state() called when element mounted
   ↓ StateLifecycle::Initialized

3. did_change_dependencies() called after init_state()
   ↓

4. build() called to create widget tree
   ↓ StateLifecycle::Ready

5. did_update_widget() called when widget changes
   ↓

6. build() called again
   ↓

7. deactivate() called when element removed
   ↓

8. dispose() called when permanently removed
   ↓ StateLifecycle::Defunct
```

### Reparenting Lifecycle (GlobalKey)

```rust
1-4. Same as normal lifecycle
   ↓

5. deactivate() called when element removed
   ↓

6. activate() called when reinserted at new location
   ↓

7. build() called at new location
   ↓

8. Eventually: deactivate() → dispose()
```

### Hot Reload Lifecycle

```rust
1-4. Normal lifecycle
   ↓

5. reassemble() called during hot reload
   ↓

6. build() called to rebuild with new code
```

## 📝 API Examples

### Basic State with Lifecycle

```rust
use flui_core::{State, BuildContext, Widget, StateLifecycle};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct CounterState {
    count: i32,
}

impl State for CounterState {
    fn init_state(&mut self) {
        println!("Counter initialized");
        // One-time initialization
    }

    fn did_change_dependencies(&mut self) {
        println!("Dependencies changed");
        // Called after init_state and when InheritedWidgets change
    }

    fn build(&mut self, context: &BuildContext) -> Box<dyn Widget> {
        // Build widget tree
        Box::new(Text::new(format!("Count: {}", self.count)))
    }

    fn did_update_widget(&mut self, old_widget: &dyn Any) {
        println!("Widget configuration changed");
        // Compare old and new widget
    }

    fn reassemble(&mut self) {
        println!("Hot reload!");
        // Re-initialize for hot reload
    }

    fn deactivate(&mut self) {
        println!("Element deactivated");
        // Pause resources
    }

    fn activate(&mut self) {
        println!("Element reactivated");
        // Resume resources
    }

    fn dispose(&mut self) {
        println!("Counter disposed");
        // Final cleanup
    }
}
```

### State with Mounted Check

```rust
impl MyState {
    async fn load_data(&mut self) {
        let data = fetch_data().await;

        // Only update if still mounted
        if self.mounted() {
            self.data = Some(data);
            // Mark dirty to rebuild
        }
    }
}
```

### State with Lifecycle Tracking

```rust
impl MyState {
    fn can_perform_action(&self) -> bool {
        // Check if in correct lifecycle state
        self.lifecycle().can_build()
    }
}
```
