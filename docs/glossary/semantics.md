semantics library
The Flutter semantics package.

To use, import package:flutter/semantics.dart.

The SemanticsEvent classes define the protocol for sending semantic events to the platform.

The SemanticsNode hierarchy represents the semantic structure of the UI and is used by the platform-specific accessibility services.

Classes
AccessibilityFeatures
Additional accessibility features that may be enabled by the platform.
AnnounceSemanticsEvent
An event for a semantic announcement.
AttributedString
A string that carries a list of StringAttributes.
AttributedStringProperty
A DiagnosticsProperty for AttributedStrings, which shows a string when there are no attributes, and more details otherwise.
ChildSemanticsConfigurationsResult
The result that contains the arrangement for the child SemanticsConfigurations.
ChildSemanticsConfigurationsResultBuilder
The builder to build a ChildSemanticsConfigurationsResult based on its annotations.
CustomSemanticsAction
An identifier of a custom semantics action.
DiagnosticPropertiesBuilder
Builder to accumulate properties and configuration used to assemble a DiagnosticsNode from a Diagnosticable object.
DiagnosticsNode
Defines diagnostics data for a value.
FocusSemanticEvent
An event to move the accessibility focus.
Key
A Key is an identifier for Widgets, Elements and SemanticsNodes.
LocaleStringAttribute
A string attribute that causes the assistive technologies, e.g. VoiceOver, to treat string as a certain language.
LongPressSemanticsEvent
An event which triggers long press semantic feedback.
Matrix4
4D Matrix. Values are stored in column major order.
Offset
An immutable 2D floating-point offset.
OrdinalSortKey
A SemanticsSortKey that sorts based on the double value it is given.
Rect
An immutable, 2D, axis-aligned, floating-point rectangle whose coordinates are relative to a given origin.
SemanticsAction
The possible actions that can be conveyed from the operating system accessibility APIs to a semantics node.
SemanticsActionEvent
An event to request a SemanticsAction of type to be performed on the SemanticsNode identified by nodeId owned by the FlutterView identified by viewId.
SemanticsConfiguration
Describes the semantic information associated with the owning RenderObject.
SemanticsData
Summary information about a SemanticsNode object.
SemanticsEvent
An event sent by the application to notify interested listeners that something happened to the user interface (e.g. a view scrolled).
SemanticsFlag
A Boolean value that can be associated with a semantics node.
SemanticsFlags
Represents a collection of boolean flags that convey semantic information about a widget's accessibility state and properties.
SemanticsHandle
A reference to the semantics information generated by the framework.
SemanticsHintOverrides
Provides hint values which override the default hints on supported platforms.
SemanticsLabelBuilder
Builder for creating semantically correct concatenated labels with proper text direction handling and spacing.
SemanticsNode
A node that represents some semantic data.
SemanticsOwner
Owns SemanticsNode objects and notifies listeners of changes to the render tree semantics.
SemanticsProperties
Contains properties used by assistive technologies to make the application more accessible.
SemanticsService
Allows access to the platform's accessibility services.
SemanticsSortKey
Base class for all sort keys for SemanticsProperties.sortKey accessibility traversal order sorting.
SemanticsTag
A tag for a SemanticsNode.
SemanticsUpdateBuilder
An object that creates SemanticsUpdate objects.
SpellOutStringAttribute
A string attribute that causes the assistive technologies, e.g. VoiceOver, to spell out the string character by character.
StringAttribute
An abstract interface for string attributes that affects how assistive technologies, e.g. VoiceOver or TalkBack, treat the text.
TapSemanticEvent
An event which triggers tap semantic feedback.
TextSelection
A range of text that represents a selection.
TextTreeConfiguration
Configuration specifying how a particular DiagnosticsTreeStyle should be rendered as text art.
TooltipSemanticsEvent
An event for a semantic announcement of a tooltip.
Enums
Assertiveness
Determines the assertiveness level of the accessibility announcement.
DebugSemanticsDumpOrder
Used by debugDumpSemanticsTree to specify the order in which child nodes are printed.
DiagnosticLevel
The various priority levels used to filter which diagnostics are shown and omitted.
DiagnosticsTreeStyle
Styles for displaying a node in a DiagnosticsNode tree.
SemanticsRole
An enum to describe the role for a semantics node.
SemanticsValidationResult
The validation result of a form field.
TextDirection
A direction in which text flows.
Mixins
SemanticsBinding
The glue between the semantics layer and the Flutter engine.
Properties
debugSemanticsDisableAnimations ↔ bool?
Overrides the setting of SemanticsBinding.disableAnimations for debugging and testing.
getter/setter pair
Functions
debugResetSemanticsIdCounter() → void
In tests use this function to reset the counter used to generate SemanticsNode.id.
Typedefs
