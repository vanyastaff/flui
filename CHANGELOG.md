# Changelog

All notable changes to the FLUI workspace are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
FLUI is pre-release and not published to crates.io; entries are grouped under
`[Unreleased]` until a first tagged release cuts them over. Workspace version:
`0.2.0` (all crates share `[workspace.package].version`). Fine-grained phase
history lives in [`docs/ROADMAP-TRACKER.md`](docs/ROADMAP-TRACKER.md); this
file records the repo-consumer-visible summary.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **CI gates**: integration tests now run in CI (previously `--lib` only —
  the Core.0/Core.2 exit-gate suites in `crates/*/tests/` were never
  executed); new `doc-test` job runs every rustdoc example; new `msrv` job
  verifies the declared 1.96 floor; new advisory `miri` job checks the
  `flui-rendering` subtree arena (the workspace's densest `unsafe` hot spot);
  the `gpu-test` WARP readback suite is promoted from advisory to
  merge-blocking after 3 consecutive green full-suite runs.
- **Panic policy** ([`docs/PANIC-POLICY.md`](docs/PANIC-POLICY.md)):
  `Result` for caller-triggerable failures, `expect("BUG: <invariant>")` for
  internal invariants, enforced by `clippy::unwrap_used` at workspace level
  (tracked crate-level opt-outs burned down per quality wave).
- This changelog.

### Changed

- **Lint normalization**: every workspace crate now inherits
  `[workspace.lints]` via `[lints] workspace = true` (12 crates previously
  bypassed workspace lints entirely; 3 carried stale local copies), enforced
  by a new drift guard in `scripts/check-workspace-inventory.sh`.
- `flui-assets` restored to `[workspace] members` — it is built and tested by
  CI again.

### Pre-changelog milestones

Recorded retroactively from `docs/ROADMAP-TRACKER.md`; evidence links live
there.

- **2026-07-01 — Core.2 exit**: full render-object catalog (37 concrete
  RenderBox/RenderSliver objects extracted to `flui-objects`), 250/250
  per-object harness tests, catalog CI guard.
- **2026-06-30 — Core.0 exit / Core.1 substantially delivered**: view/element
  core contracts locked (`specs/004-view-element-core`, keyed reconciliation,
  `IntoView` authoring surface, element storage); `flui-widgets` slice with 14
  widget families; `flui-animation` re-enabled; production vsync + lazy
  slivers end-to-end; C1.11 contract-validation report (4,847 tests passing).
  Core.1 formal exit still awaits a windowed run (C1.10/C1.12 — see the OPEN
  ITEM in the tracker).
- **2026-06 — GPU engine hardening**: WGSL readback/oracle suite (~440 tests)
  runs on CI via WARP; image-filter pipeline (blur/ColorFilter) sized to
  content bounds; deterministic-replay IR purity witness.
- **Business.1 (in flight)**: Flutter widget-catalog port continues
  (`RichText`/`Icon` landed); tracked in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
