# Implementation Plan: flui-platform MVP - Cross-Platform Support

**Branch**: `dev` | **Date**: 2026-01-26 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/dev/spec.md`

## Summary

Complete flui-platform crate to MVP-ready state with cross-platform support for Windows and macOS. The crate provides platform abstraction for window management, text systems, event handling, display enumeration, async executors, and clipboard operations. Current implementation is 90-100% complete for Windows/macOS but lacks text system integration (critical for rendering) and macOS hardware testing. MVP focuses on completing these blockers and ensuring 70%+ test coverage.

**Technical Approach**: Use native platform APIs (Win32, AppKit) for best control, adopt GPUI's proven patterns (Platform trait, callback registry, type erasure), follow Flutter's modular binding approach, and use W3C-standard events for consistency.

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
